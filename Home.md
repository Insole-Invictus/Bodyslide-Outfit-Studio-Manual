## What is BodySlide?
BodySlide provides an easy way to customize outfits and bodies without the need to edit mesh files yourself. The project files for BodySlide are created in Outfit Studio.

Furthermore, it uses a simple configuration and data format, allowing it to be expanded to work for any body, outfit or different mesh.

You can customize the addons you installed using sliders to create your personal shapes and edits. Fancy outfit and group filtering quickly shows you the sets you are looking for, while the textured preview windows show you what you are going to get.

## What is Outfit Studio?
Outfit Studio lets you convert outfits between bodies using conversion references, create your own sliders for BodySlide, correct animation weights and edit meshes with brushes or transform tools.

You can load already existing BodySlide projects and tweak them or create entirely new ones. It is also possible to create mashups of various outfits you like by loading them all into the program, keeping the shapes you like and deleting the ones you don't.

If you know what you're doing, you can even edit static meshes.
There are features for import and export of .FBX, .OBJ and .NIF files of both meshes and sliders.
