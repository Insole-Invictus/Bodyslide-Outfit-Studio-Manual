## What are groups for?
Groups in BodySlide are multiple project entries bundled together under one name. They can be used to **filter the outfit list** and/or choose which ones to use for a **batch build**.

Slider presets are saved to specific groups as well, so that they will appear only for those. For that reason, all bodies and outfits of a specific set of sliders need to be added to a **master group** that can be used for all presets. In the image below, this would be the **CBBE** group.

The group filter can be adjusted at the top of the BodySlide frame by clicking the magnifying glass icon and then **Choose Groups**. The result of the filter will show in the outfit and batch build list.

## Creating and editing groups
To **create new groups or edit existing ones**, open the group manager dialog with the button in the BodySlide frame. If you want to edit an existing group file, click the **browse** button and select the XML file it's stored in. To create a new group file, simply start adding groups and members in the manager window.

The panel in the top-left corner has a **list of all groups**. You can add new ones below by typing a group name into the text box and clicking the **Add Group** button. If you are adding an outfit to its own group for easier batch building, make sure to add it to the matching **master group for the body** as well, if one exists.

To add a new member to a group, **select the group first** and the members you want to add to it afterwards from the big list to the right of the group manager. Then click the **Add** button below. The current members of the selected group are listed in the bottom-left corner.

BodySlide loads the group files from the **SliderGroups** folder, so that's where they should be saved to once you're done editing.
