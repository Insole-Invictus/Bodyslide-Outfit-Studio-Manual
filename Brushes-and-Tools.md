## What are the brushes for?
Outfit Studio provides you with multiple brush tools that can be activated in the toolbar or menu bar. They can be used to **modify the meshes** of a project in all kinds of ways.

Most of them change their behavior while you hold down a **modifier key**, such as CTRL, ALT or SHIFT. You can **undo and redo** the changes with the CTRL+Z and CTRL+Y shortcuts.
